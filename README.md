**_Project Name:_** Around the U.S.

**_Project Description:_**

The page does not have any actual function, but nearly every element on the page is part of a flex-box or grid-type layout. These techniques ensure that blocks and elements follow predictable and manageable positioning and sizing that can be logically maintained.
CSS Grid is implemented in the image cards as an alternative to flex-box because of the ratio of simplicity to requirements. Using flexbox would require more positioning and considerations that CSS Grid is designed to tackle.
When positioning major blocks of elements in single rows or columns, however, flex-box was used since it can achieve that with little code.

The page also features responsive design for screen sizes between 320px and 1280px, inclusive. This was achieved with media queries and implicit sizing techniques like `minmax()`, `max-width`, `auto-fit`, and the `calc()` function.
Where text may overflow their containers, special rules were implemented to ensure they stay within their respective boundaries according to the design.
